                        About the project: In this case we developped a test management system for a large German bank. It was a small
                        project which concentrated on the things which had the greatest business value. We used <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> in combination
                        with Spring MVC. Despite the fact that many team members weren't  familiar with the technic stack, the project
                        could be realized in time and budget.
