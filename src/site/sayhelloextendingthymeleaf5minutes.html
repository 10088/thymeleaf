    <h1>Say Hello! Extending Thymeleaf in 5 minutes</h1>

    <p>
      Extending Thymeleaf is easy: you only have to create a dialect and add it to your
      template engine. Let's see how.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(All the code seen here comes from a working application. You can download the source code
      of such application from the <a href="documentation.html">documentation page</a>)</i> 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Dialects</h2>
    
    <p>
      Thymeleaf Dialects are sets of features you can use in your templates. These features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Processing logic</b> specified via <i>tags</i> and <i>attributes</i>, which are
          executed by <i>tag / attribute processors</i>. These tag or attribute processors
          can also use a third type of processor also present in dialects: <i>value processors</i>, which are in
          charge of performing computations needed throughout the dialect (e.g. processing
          the dialect's expression language).</li>
      <li><b>DOCTYPE transformations</b> which allow the automatic conversion of the template's
          DOCTYPE declaration into a target one, thus allowing validation both before processing
          --against a DTD including the dialect's tags and attributes-- and after processing
          --against a DTD not including these, like e.g. a standard XHTML DTD.</li>
      <li><b>DOCTYPE resolution entries</b> which are fed into Thymeleaf's template parser and allow
          the resolution of DTD files for the validation of templates (if required) in an offline manner, 
          this is, without the need to perform remote HTTP connections and/or download anything.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these features are optional, and a dialect can specify only some of them. For example,
      neither the Standard nor the Spring Thymeleaf dialect include any <i>tag processors</i>, which
      is why all template features are written into <tt>th:*</tt> attributes when using any of these
      dialects.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, that "<tt>th</tt>" in <tt>th:*</tt> is called the <b>dialect prefix</b>, and it
      means that all tags and attributes processed by that dialect will start with
      such prefix.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important also to note that <b>a Template Engine can be set several dialects at a time</b>,
      thus allowing the processing of templates including features from all of the specified dialects
      (think of dialects as a sort of <i>JSP taglibs</i> in steroids).
      What's more, some of these dialects can <i>share prefix</i>, effectively acting as an aggregate
      dialect.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The simplest dialect ever: Say Hello!</h2>
    
    <p>
      Let's create a dialect for one of our applications. This will be a Spring MVC application, so
      we will be already using the Spring Thymeleaf dialect (have a look at the 
      <a href="documentation.html">Thymeleaf + Spring 3 tutorial</a> for more details). But we
      want to add a new attribute that allows us to say hello to whoever we want, like this:
    </p>    
    
    <code>
&lt;<b>p</b>&nbsp;hello:sayto=<span class="string">&quot;World&quot;</span>&gt;Hi&nbsp;ya!&lt;/<b>p</b>&gt;
    </code>
    
    <h3>The attribute processor</h3>
    
    <p>
      First, we will have to create the attribute processor that will take care of displaying
      our salutation message. All attribute processors implement the
      <tt>org.thymeleaf.processor.attr.IAttrProcessor</tt> interface, but several convenience
      abstract implementations exist that ease the development of each type of processor. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, the <tt>AbstractTextChildModifierAttrProcessor</tt>
      class specializes in attributes that substitute the body of the tag they sit on by
      a text (which is exactly what we want). So we will extend this class for our attribute
      processor:
    </p>
    <p>
      [CODE HERE]
    </p>

    <h3>The dialect class</h3>
    
    <p>
      Creating our processor was very easy, but now we will need to create the <i>dialect class</i>,
      which will be in charge of telling Thymeleaf that our processor is available. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We could make our dialect implement the <tt>org.thymeleaf.dialect.IDialect</tt> interface (which is the one
      every dialect should implement), but instead we will extend a convenience abstract class 
      called <tt>AbstractDialect</tt> that
      already implements all methods from that interface, returning empty values for all of them (so
      that we only have to override the ones we require).
    </p>
    <p>
      [CODE HERE, WITHOUT ADVANCED ARTIFACTS]
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, we didn't need to set any <i>DOCTYPE resolution entries</i> or <i>translations</i>, nor
      we specify any <i>value processors</i>. We didn't need any of that because our dialect
      is meant to be used together with the Spring Thymeleaf dialect, which already includes
      a useful set of all those things (although we could have defined them here also if for some reason we wanted 
      to be more exhaustive). All our dialect does is specify a prefix (<tt>hello</tt>), a <i>leniency</i>,
      and our <i>"sayto"</i> attribute processor.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Using the hello dialect</h2>
    
    <p>
      Using our new dialect is very easy. This being a Spring MVC application, we just have to add
      it to the <i>dialects</i> property of the Template Engine bean:
    </p>
    
    <p>
    [SPRING BEAN XML CODE HERE]
    </p>

    <p>
      And our new attribute would work seamlessly:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;<b>p</b>&gt;Hello&nbsp;World!&lt;/<b>p</b>&gt;
    </code>
