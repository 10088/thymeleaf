- Add "baseValues" to testable resolvers, as Map<String,String>. It will not work as evaluators'
  "default" values in the sense that base values will be considered as if they were actually written in
  test files. 
- Create an "order" property in testable resolvers, make TestEngine allow several, and create some kind
  of property that allows to decide whether one resolver or another should do the job of resolving a testable.
  Also, make sure the entire resolver chain is executed when using %EXTENDS.
- Allow context values in DefaultContextTestFieldEvaluator to be specified as OGNL (extensible to SpringEL)
- Create formats for specifying order of files in sequences, exclusions, inclusions, etc.
- Allow the possibility of referencing a test from a different folder, a kind of "pointer test". For example,
  this could be a .ref file or something similar. That way we can include exactly the same test as if it were
  in different folders (for example, interesting for warming up during benchmarking).
