 Building thymeleaf
 ------------------
 
 In order to build thymeleaf you will need Maven 3. You can get it at:
 
     http://maven.apache.org

 Build and install the project executing, from the thymeleaf
 project root folder:
 
     mvn clean package

 Besides all the binary, javadoc and sources artifacts, this will generate
 a Thymeleaf distribution archive in the "dist/target" folder.
